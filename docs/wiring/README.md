# HART LCOS wiring documentation

Git copy of the Desktop `HART/Wiring Documentation` package, refreshed against current public names and Digicon searchlight heads.

Desktop originals stay at `~/Desktop/HART/Wiring Documentation/`. That tree is **not** git — it has a Python venv and an `ARCHIVE/` of every inventory bump. Root `.gitignore` still ignores a repo-root `Wiring Documentation/` folder so that checkout is not committed by accident.

## Current files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| [`LCOS_Layout_Inventory_v85.xlsx`](LCOS_Layout_Inventory_v85.xlsx) | LCOS nodes, DNOU8/DNIN8, block sensors, turnout summary. **DigiconSignals** sheet is generated from `cats/data/signal_wiring.csv`. **Node ID = C{radio Address}** (helix DCC is **D5**). **Legacy Node ID** is the old sequential C1–C13 / D1 label. |
| [`Wiring_Schematic.pptx`](Wiring_Schematic.pptx) | One slide per client node, regenerated from v85. |
| [`signals_asbuilt_abs_v2.xlsx`](signals_asbuilt_abs_v2.xlsx) | Live lower-deck Digicon ABS matrix (100L, 117LA, 114LA, …). |
| [`signals_split_v8.xlsx`](signals_split_v8.xlsx) | Frozen Nov 2025 **planned RGB** matrix (`S1-1`…`S6-15`). Upper deck still uses this plan. Do not rename those IDs to Digicon 11x names. |
| [`imported/`](imported/) | Unmodified Desktop snapshots (v84, asbuilt v1, split v8, v84 changelog). Sequential C1–C13 IDs. |

CSV source of truth for Digicon ports: [`cats/data/signal_wiring.csv`](../../cats/data/signal_wiring.csv). Public block names: [`occupancy_bindings.csv`](../../cats/data/occupancy_bindings.csv) / [ADR-005](../../wiki/decisions/ADR-005-public-equipment-names.md).

**Enclosure = radio Address.** Packed MQTT already uses Address except Plane/Brick heads, which stay `4xx` (LCOS display node 4) on **C3** (radio 3). Princess on **C1**, never **D5**. East End signals **C2** (radio 2; OU1 as 5V); East End turnouts **C12** (radio 12). Barn **C13**. Princess overflow + **2035/2036** on **C11**. One 3-pin `STOP/APPROACH/CLEAR` head per mast.

**6LA** (was documented as 102LA) is a 1-head dwarf on `C3-OU2-4` / `IH434`. `C3-OU2` packed hole for old 102LA Bottom / IH435 is unused; do not reuse it for 101RA. `signals_split_v8.xlsx` stays the frozen RGB plan.

Copy the three current workbooks **and** `Wiring_Schematic.pptx` back to `~/Desktop/HART/Wiring Documentation/` after a refresh (and after XML apply) so the bench copy matches git.

## Refresh

```bash
python3 docs/wiring/scripts/refresh_wiring_docs.py
# needs python-pptx (Desktop wiring venv is fine):
python3 docs/wiring/scripts/create_wiring_schematic_ppt.py
```

Copy `LCOS_Layout_Inventory_v85.xlsx`, `signals_asbuilt_abs_v2.xlsx`, `signals_split_v8.xlsx`, and `Wiring_Schematic.pptx` to `~/Desktop/HART/Wiring Documentation/`. Do not refresh Desktop until JMRI XML is applied so the bench pack matches live beans.

## What v85 changed vs Desktop v84

- Lower-deck **BlockSensors** names follow the panel: Scale, Barn, S-1…S-5, W-1/W-2, EH-1…EH-3, OS 100… (MQTT `Block n-n` stays in Notes).
- **DNOU8** ports listed in `signal_wiring.csv` are overlayed as searchlight heads (replacing planned RGB `S3-6 G` etc. on those ports). Previous RGB label is kept in Notes.
- **D1-OU2/OU3** Princess rows were a mistaken overlay (D1 is DCC radio 5, now labeled **D5**). Princess is on C1; do not recreate D5 signal boards.
- Upper-deck RGB (`S4-*` / `S5-*` / `S6-*`) left as planned.
- **Node ID = radio Address** (`C2` is radio 2 / East End signals; old C2 tape is **C12**). v84 sequential C1–C13 IDs live in **Legacy Node ID** and `imported/`.
